Description: A database-agnostic implementation of the HIPPS (Hierarchical 
    Identification of Pregnancy and Pregnancy Progression Signatures) algorithm 
    for identifying pregnancy episodes in OMOP CDM databases. This package 
    provides reliable pregnancy episode identification across all OMOP CDM 
    platforms including SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Databricks, BigQuery, 
    and Snowflake. It combines the HIP and PPS algorithms with the ESD 
    (Estimated Start Date) refinement for comprehensive pregnancy identification.
